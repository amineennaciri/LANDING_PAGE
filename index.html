<!-- 
Additionally, there are a few small details 
that you may not have encountered in our lessons yet.
This is by design. These details are minor,
and easily searched (e.g. google css rounded corners). -->

<!-- 
Get your project as close as you can to the design,
 but do not worry about getting it pixel-perfect.
  Donâ€™t get out your ruler or count pixels to find the
   exact margins between the various sections.
    The point of this assignment is to create something
	 from scratch and get the various elements in more
	  or less the right position relative to the rest -->
