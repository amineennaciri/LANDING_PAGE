This is the landing page project from TOP(the odin project) foundations course.

This project is about building an entire website from a design provided.

The design provided comes in the form of 2 images: one is an image of the complete website, and one has some details about some of the fonts and colors weâ€™ve used.

By the end of the project, I will have demonstrated skills in setting up a website using my HTML and CSS knowledge.

NOTE: this project has no history of commits inside of it, it is due to the fact that I realized this project before setting up my git and github, and before committing to the odin project. At the time I was searching for a ressource to practice flexbox, and I stumbled upon this project, it was a great opportunity to discover the odin project curriculum and commit to it.  

Self-reflection and conclusion:

This project was a great opportunity to put into practice my recent learning in CSS and flexbox..
I was able to build a landing page from scratch using a design as a reference.
I got more confident in my ability to build websites.
